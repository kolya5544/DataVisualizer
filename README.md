# DataVisualization

**DataVisualization** allows you to build a bitmap that visualizes the contents of a file using HSL scheme. This software is pretty useless, however it might help reveal certain patterns (if any).

Usage: `DataVisualization.exe <data> <output filename> [optional]<stepsize> [optional]<bias>`, where `data` is filepath of input file, `output filename` is filepath to output file, `stepsize` is the size of a step as the program iterates over data and `bias` is initial offset.
